# Carnatic_FSM

A generative model for Indian Carnatic music using Finite State Machines. While, obviously, more sophisticated models could be built for generating (Indian classical) music, it is worth noting that this non-neural-network based approach is a plausible baseline at the very least.


Blog post explaining the approach - [Coming soon]

# Music library
This repo uses [Music21](http://web.mit.edu/music21/) to programatically construct the musical piece and save it as a score as well as in midi format.
